However, it was surprisingly moist and rich for such a simple cake. I used a chocolate frosting and put fresh raspberries between the layers and on top for my little sister's birthday. It was great!

Someone even said that it was impressive enough to be entered into a state fair (not that any of us had ever been to one). I watched as everyone savored every bite. It's moist, flavorful, rich, and has a great texture. I'm not a fan of nuts in baked goods, so I left them out. Raisins might be a nice addition as well. I baked it in 2 round nine-inch pans and set the timer for 30 minutes but kept it in longer until it was golden brown. It would be great without icing, but I HAD to top it off with homemade cream cheese icing. This is a keeper and although I'd like to claim this recipe as my own, I have no problem giving credit to Jane Graham, Ann Arber, and RecipeZaar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!\",\n",

I wished while I was baking this cake that I were a spoon or bowl in which the ingredients were mixed by me to make it.\\r\\nI used 1 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Fresh milk and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. Rest of the things I have stuck to this recipe. It\\'s a very nice cake and quite easy too. The fact that it is eggless makes it all the more nice as many people I know don\\'t have eggs at all, hence, I have many more soon going to be \"lovers\" of this cake! I\\'d say that if your depressed or low, request mom to make this for u if u love cakes n chocolate - Just put in 1 piece  of cake and watch your depression run away for miles from you:) Last but not the least, I loved the deep dark brown colour of the cake when done. I garnished it with some chopped almonds and maraschino cherries that made it look all the more yummy and mouth watering and oh well, my stomach says \"Give me more of Depression Fudge cake now and NOW means NOWWWWWW\"!!!:)',\n",
